IDEOLOGY:
    train.py is mainly used to detect and recognize some sample faces 
    from a group of photos provided by the user. Later on we can merge this to be a feature of the main app.

    recognize.py is used to recognize the photos from the larger batch of files which use the detected
    snippets from the previous train.py.

    Another use case could be to identify distinct faces from a batch of photos. This feature requires a
    conjunction of train.py and recognize.py.
